With the help of appropriate employee table, implement all types of Views.  

-- schema + sample data
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS customer;

CREATE TABLE customer (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  city VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  order_date DATE
);

INSERT INTO customer VALUES (1,'Alice','Mumbai'),(2,'Bob','Pune'),(3,'Cathy','Delhi');
INSERT INTO orders VALUES (101,1,2500,'2025-10-01'),(102,1,1500,'2025-10-05'),(103,4,900,'2025-10-07');

-- INNER JOIN
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
INNER JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- LEFT JOIN (customers with or without orders)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN (orders with or without matching customers)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- CROSS JOIN (Cartesian)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id
FROM customer c
CROSS JOIN orders o;

-- SELF JOIN example on customer (find pairs in same city)
SELECT c1.customer_id AS id1, c1.name AS name1, c2.customer_id AS id2, c2.name AS name2
FROM customer c1
JOIN customer c2 ON c1.city = c2.city AND c1.customer_id <> c2.customer_id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN emulation (MySQL)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
UNION
SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, o.order_id, o.amount
FROM customer c
RIGHT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
